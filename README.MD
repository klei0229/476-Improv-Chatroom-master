Warning: to add/change new style in external file, don't be worried about if the page
didn't make any change. You need to refresh the css file in website in order make it work in html,
if this still didn't work, you need to inspect element -> source -> find the css file -> fresh.
For exmaple, if you change/add something in chatroom.css. Refresh the page of 127.../static/css/chatroom.css
make sure the change/addition you made is in there, refresh the html page.
